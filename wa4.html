<h1 id="myArgument">Who will be the big cameo in the remaining episodes of WandaVision?</h1>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; WandaVision is a new show that came out in January by Marvel that is airing now on Disney+. It is a continuing piece of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or the MCU, with the earlier movies such as Iron Man, Captain America, Avengers, etc. WandaVision is currently on the seventh episode out of 10, and the big question many fans are asking is who the big cameo will be that is supposedly making an appearance in the final few episodes. A lot of theorists believe it could be Michael Fassbender's Magneto from X-Men, Captain Marvel played by Brie Larsen, or maybe even Dr. Strange played by Benedict Cumberbatch. My belief is that it will be Micheal Fassbender's Magneto because of the hidden easter eggs shown throughout the show and the accuracy from the original Marvel comics. </p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The reason Magneto will be the big cameo towards the finale of the show is because of the accuracy the show has previously had with the original comic book titled, 'House of M'. In this book, Magneto plays a crucial role where she is Wanda Maximoff's, the main character in WandaVision, father. The overall plot is that Wanda creates an alternate reality where the villain tried to confuse Wanda, ultimately to steal her powerful children. So far in WandaVision, the plot seems to fairly resemble the House of M plot. She has creaetd an alternate reality with her powers and has already given birth to her powerful twin, Billy and Tommy. Since Disney has bought 21st century in the past year or so, the rights to X-Men characetrs are all in Disney's hands now. Before, they were in competely seperate universes and legally could not be intertwined. So now, the possibilities are endless, where no Marvel character is off limits to bring into the primary universe called the Marvel Cinematic Universe. They have already brought in Quicksilver in episode 5 of WandaVision played by Evan Peters, the same actor who played Quicksilver in 21st Century's X-Men. So, the addition of the X-Men are already starting to happen, which is why I believe Magento will be the last cameo in the show that everyone has been waiting for. </p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The reason the hyped up cameo will not be Dr. Strange is that Magneto coming in would simply make more sense. The film Dr. Strange and the Multiverse of Madness is already under production, which features Wanda Maximoff. I think they will save Dr. Strange for that film, and Marvel will decline to bring him in this early. So far, the plot wouldn't make too much sense to bring in this character as well unless the plot takes an unexpected turn. The only way he could, in my opinion, is that he will be the one to bring down Wanda's alternate reality for the safety of the civilians she has in the town without their own free will, controlled by Wanda herself. This theory does not seem likely at this point of the show because there hasn't been any easter eggs that could point to that. Marvel loves to shows clues and hints towards their big reveal or next major plot point.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Captain Marvel being the cameo for the end of WandaVision has some possibilty but seems very unlikely to me. Another main character in the show named Monica Rambeau is close friends to Captain Marvel, noted from the film, 'Captain Marvel' which came out in 2019. Her appearance would only be possible because of her close relations with Monica who has gotten her powers through Wanda's powers in the most recent episode. Captain Marvel becoming intertwined in this series honestly makes no sense at all because the plot of House of M never mentions her once. Her powers and her duties around the universe would fit in very poorly to this plot. </p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The potential for the upcoming major cameo has no limits, but theorists such as myself will always try to make the best case for an argument and until the reveal happens, anyone's guess is as good as most. Marvel loves to throw crazy, unexpected characters together for the fans, making it my favorite movie/TV show franchise. These are the top three theories as of now, but the Magneto played by Michael Fassbender makes the most sense to me because of my knowledge of the plot in House of M, a Marvel comic. </p>
